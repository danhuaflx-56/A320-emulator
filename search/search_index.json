Real pilots undergo years of training in real world classes and hours in real FAA approved simulators, something enthusiasts cannot have at their fingertips. Enthusiasts like myself had to be self-taught by watching numerous videos or examining real footage of cockpit action. In making this wesbite, I want to be able to share what I know of the A320 to make the learning process much easier than how I had to learn before.   </p> About A320 Emulator <p>     This project is designed to help aviation enthusiasts and pilots explore the Airbus A320 systems in a realistic environment. It includes detailed guides, procedures, and tips for mastering cockpit operations. Contrary to the name of this project, most of the components of the structure of this emulator will be in the form of documentations, or articles that demonstrate or explain flying an Airbus.       The Emulator will be based on the following     *The Fenix A320 for Microsoft Flight Simulator (although the general knowledge can be applied to the majority of simualtors)     *Knowledge of basic aircraft flight and instrument flying (though some concepts may be explained, it's best to learn about them separately, which you can access in resources)  Of course, there may be mistakes here and there, and if you do spot any, be sure to contact me at daniel56huang@gmail.com   </p> The Mission <p>     When I joined the flight simulation community, it was difficult to self-study aircraft at a deep level. In the real world, pilots have dedicated classes and access to official documents and training. Our goal is to make learning aviation systems accessible and interactive, providing users with the tools to gain knowledge, practice procedures, and enjoy the simulation experience, up to the highest realism.    </p> Contact: <p>daniel56huang@gmail.com</p>        \u00a9 2025 A320 Emulator.
