# About
This website was created because I wanted to share the knowledge of aviation to those who cannot access it. Real pilots undergo years of training in real world classes and hours in real FAA approved simulators, something enthusiasts cannot have at their fingertips. Enthusiasts like myself had to be self-taught by watching numerous videos or examining real footage of cockpit action. In making this wesbite, I want to be able to share what I know of the A320 to make the learning process much easier than how I had to learn before.
